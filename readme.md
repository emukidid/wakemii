# README : WakeMii

# what is it?
WakeMii was a personal project inspired by a need for a calmer alarm than a recently purchased one which felt a bit too intense for my liking. It's an alarm clock app for the Wii which allows you to drop a bunch of "albums" and "hourly" MP3 files with each album also allowing cover-art. It can also be used as a niche MP3 player with features such as prev/next track/album or random play.

The alarm track is always chosen at random, as is the hourly track.

## QUICK USAGE:
### Storage Setup
 * Place .mp3 files in the following directory structure:
    * /wakemii/albums/\<some album name>/*.mp3
    * /wakemii/albums/\<some album name>/cover.png
    * /wakemii/albums/\<another album name>/*.mp3
    * /wakemii/albums/\<some album name>/cover.jpg
    * /wakemii/hourly/*.mp3
* JPG, PNG and BMP are supported for cover art.

### Controls:
For a Wii, only a Wii remote is supported. For GameCube, only a GC controller.

## Issues
* :warning: **Cover art must be small because GRRLIB likes to crash or just
simply not display images if they're too big, I recommend 320x240
although I've had sizes up to 800x600 work but it can be hit or miss.**
* I have only tried 128kbps MP3 files, larger bitrate files might have issues
* The alarm will only sound for a minute (or less if the track chosen is less), it cannot be cancelled/snoozed.
* The GameCube version is completely broken, I assume GRRLIB is to blame.
* There are probably bugs!

## Possible future features
* Stop using crappy/unreadable fonts
* Move away from GRRLIB usage
* Mii integration with Mii specific profiles for the hell of it
* MOD music file support
* VGMStream integration for loads more files

## Building
Have a working devKitPro & libOGC2 setup, then hack at GRRLIB to get it building and placed in the correct portlibs location (until a proper updated/packaged version exists). After that, just type make and it should compile.
